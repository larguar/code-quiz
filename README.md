# Coding Quiz

You have 60 seconds to answer 5 code-related questions. To move on to the next question, you must answer the current question correctly. Your time limit will decrease by 10 seconds every time you answer a question incorrectly. Your final score is measured by the time it takes to answer all 5 questions.
